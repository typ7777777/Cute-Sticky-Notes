This project only contain the binary file of Cute Sticky Notes App, the binary file is compiled by C#,  and this project is **only for qualify hacker&lt;reverse engineer>** to read the idea --
`Show how to implement importants features with smallest code, e.g.:`

1) **2D UI engine.** (the key framework for create your custom OS desktop & windows system or &lt;text & image>browser&lt;also include a text editor>)
2) **Database & File System** (with fast compress/search support, the fs protocol tell you the key tech about the network of files)  
3) **Data Struct Protocol** (as a universal computer data communicate protocol with fast compress/search support. e.g. something like json/http(s) protocol maybe out of date someday, but it will not.)
4) **Async** in old language that don't support. (for manually code)
